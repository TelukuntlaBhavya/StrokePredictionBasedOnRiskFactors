# Stroke Prediction Based on Risk Factors

This project is a machine learning-based stroke prediction system developed using healthcare data. It was created as part of my Data Science Minor Project at Lovely Professional University.

The model predicts the likelihood of a stroke based on features like age, BMI, average glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle factors.

## What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categories, scaled features)
- Applied SMOTE to balance the dataset
- Trained two models: Logistic Regression (baseline) and Random Forest (after SMOTE)
- Evaluated models using Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve, and Confusion Matrix

## Key Takeaways

- SMOTE significantly improved stroke case detection
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression on the balanced data
- Data preprocessing and class balancing are crucial for health predictions
